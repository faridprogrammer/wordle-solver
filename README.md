## How it words
This npm package uses a simple pattern and enumerates all (meaningful/meaningless) words to be seen by user and help he/she quess the correct word.

This package has been developed as a hobby and for fun. I DO NOT recommend using any tool like this to solve games.

Currently I have not connected the package with a english dictionary to enumerate meaningful words. My plan is to do so ASAP.
